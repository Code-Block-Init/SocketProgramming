For "Centralization":-(operations) Check this link:

=====================================================

"Decentralization" concept of one client to many servers is aimed...

Communication- https://github.com/dragonwolverines/SocketProgramming/blob/master/readme_decentralized_communication.txt

Operations - https://github.com/dragonwolverines/SocketProgramming/blob/master/readme_decentralization_operations

==================

Here, one client and two servers using Java is coded. written in notepad and implemented in windows command prompt using JDK 1.6 platform.

Issues:- Successfully compiled, but while entering texts during run-time, it's giving issues... Like in the "if-else" loop, "if" is not executed, but "else" is directly executed (decentralization & centralization operations), but in decentralization communication, there is sudden error occuring while running the output. (O_O)

Any Java developer is welcomed? :/
